# Recaptcha-Solver Made by Pr0t0ns
PLEASE STAR REPO (50 Stars and I will make Funcaptcha Solver Next)

**Selenium Based Python Solver for Recaptcha**
Run main.py

Features
* Solves in about 10-20 seconds
* config.json let's you customize a few options such as headerless browser and console prints

**Important**
* You must have ffmpeg Installed and added to PATH (This is required because of file conversion .mp3 -> .wav)
* You can edit the code so it solves on ur own custom url
* If you have any good suggestions feel free to open a ticket and I will add it in
* Feel free to create PR If they're good I will merge them

In Progress
* I am thinking about making some parts of the code requests based so they not everything is done via browser this will make the program much faster (Not sure if i will add this yet though)
