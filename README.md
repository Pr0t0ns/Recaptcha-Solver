# Recaptcha-Solver Made by Pr0t0ns
PLEASE STAR REPO (50 Stars and I will make Funcaptcha Solver Next)

**Undetected Selenium Based Python Solver for Recaptcha**
Run main.py

Features
* Solves in about 10-20 seconds
* config.json let's you customize a few options such as headerless browser and console prints

**Important**
* You must have ffmpeg Installed and added to PATH (This is required because of file conversion .mp3 -> .wav)
* You can edit the code so it solves on ur own custom url
* If you have any good suggestions feel free to open a ticket and I will add it in
* Feel free to create PR If they're good I will merge them

In Progress
* I am thinking about making some parts of the code requests based so they not everything is done via browser this will make the program much faster (Not sure if i will add this yet though)

Additonal Notes
* For Some reason if you enable headerless browser option it becomes slower at solving not exactly sure why
* You may need to Customize some of the iframe XPATH's if your trying to solve on another website than the one it's using
